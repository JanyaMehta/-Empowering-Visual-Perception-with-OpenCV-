 Empowering Visual Perception with OpenCV                                            

Object Detection is a computer technology related to computer vision, image processing, and deep learning that deals
with detecting instances of objects in images and videos.

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a
major role in real-time operation which is very important in today’s systems. By using it, one can process images and
videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.
